[Change Log](./Changelog.md)

## Ansible Requirements

This playbook has tested with the next Ansible versions:

		ansible 2.2.1.0
		ansible 2.3.0.0
		ansible 2.3.1.0

The playbook has to be executed with **root permission**, using the **root user** or
via **sudo** because it will install packages and configure the hosts.

## RHEL Subscription Required

This role is prepared to be executed in a RHEL7 Server. Subscription is required to
execute the **Grant RHEL and Fuse repos enabled** task, which enables the required
repositories to install Fuse dependencies

## Global and Host Variables

### Global Variables

Each playbook will use a set of Global Variables with values that it will be the same for all of them.

These variables will be defined in **groups_vars/all.yaml** file.

These variables are:

* **fuse**: Define the Red Hat JBoss Fuse version and patch to install. This values will
	form the path the the binaries: */tmp/jboss-fuse-karaf-{{ fuse['version'] }}.redhat-{{ fuse['patch'] }}.zip*

		# Fuse Version and Patch
		fuse:
			version: '6.3.0'
			patch: '254'
			maven_version: '630262'

* **user**: OS user to execute the Fuse process.

		# OS User to install/execute Fuse
		user:
			name: 'fuse'
			shell: '/bin/bash'
			homedir: 'True'

* **java_home**: Path to Java Virtual Machine to execute the process.

		java_home: /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk

* **fuse_base**: Fuse base path where it will be installed everything.

		# Fuse Home
		fuse_base: '/opt/fuse'

* **fuse_home**: Fuse Home path where it will installed each instance. This
	variable will be defined for each host with a name. This allow installs more
	instances in the same hosts.

		# Fuse Home
		fuse_home: '{{ fuse_base }}/latest-{{ esb_name }}'

* **fuse_client**: Fuse Client command line to connect to a RHJF instance. It will
 	use administrative credentials.

		fuse_client: '{{ fuse_home }}/bin/client -r 3 -d 10 -u {{ fuse_users.admin.username }} -p {{ fuse_users.admin.password }}'

### Host Variables

Each role will use a set of Host Variables defined in the playbook for each
host defined in the inventory.

These variables are:

* **esb_name**: Logical name to identify each Fuse Instance. Mandatory.
* **port_offset**: Port offset to be added to default Fuse ports. Mandatory.

These variables should be defined in the playbook as:

		roles:
			# Two Fuse Standalone with a Network of Brokers

the host where the playbook will be executed.

#### Configuration parameters

Role's execution could be configured with the following variables.

Global Variables are defined in **group_vars/all.yaml** file.:

* **fuse_users**: Users map to be created in each Fuse instance. These users will
	be stored in **{{ fuse_home }}/etc/users.properties** file.

		# Fuse Administrative Users
		fuse_users:
			admin:
